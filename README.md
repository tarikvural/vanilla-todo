# Vanilla ToDo App

Written fully in vanilla JS, HTML and CSS 

## Why?
I worked on this during my breaks at work, without access to an IDE or any form of front-/backend library, so its a little scuffed due to being written in Notepad++

## What
Its a basic todo app, you can create little ToDos, mark them as Done and have an overview on what is to do\
The Color Palette is Vanilla (obviously) and giving chocolatey-vanillaey vibes
